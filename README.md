Moods allow you to create Spotify Playlist based on genre and 5 different audio features :
- Acousticness (whether the song is sounding electronic or acoustic)
- Danceability
- Energy
- Valence (whether it is sounding positive or negative)
- Popularity (whether it is famous or not)

The app is linked to your Spotify account and the playlist are also available in your Spotify app.
